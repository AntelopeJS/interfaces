This repository contains interface definitions for the AntelopeJS ecosystem. Interfaces define standardized APIs that allow different modules to communicate with each other and enable interoperability within the AntelopeJS modular architecture.

## What are Interfaces?

Interfaces in AntelopeJS provide standardized contracts between modules. They define the available methods, properties, and types that implementing modules must adhere to. This allows developers to:

1. Use different implementations of the same interface interchangeably
2. Develop modules that can communicate with other modules through these standardized contracts
3. Build modular applications where components can be easily swapped or updated

## Publishing Interfaces

For detailed information about creating and publishing interfaces to the AntelopeJS ecosystem, please refer to the [Publishing Interfaces](https://antelopejs.com/docs/interfaces/publishing-interfaces) documentation.

## Getting Started

To use these interfaces in your AntelopeJS project, refer to the individual interface documentation or the general [Interfaces Introduction](https://antelopejs.com/docs/interfaces/introduction) guide.
